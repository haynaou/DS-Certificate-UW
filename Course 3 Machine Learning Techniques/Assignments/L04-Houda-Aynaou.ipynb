    "## Workplace Scenario\n",
    "You are working for a data science consulting company. Your company is approached by a client requesting that you analyze crime data across the United States using [Communities and Crime dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/communities/). At first glance, you notice that the data has 128 attributes and cannot be examined manually. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR. You are tasked to identify which are the most important features or attributes that contribute to crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, such data might be used for predictive policing, where police departments can predict potential criminal activity so they can ensure they are properly staffed and the areas of concern are patrolled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## To do:\n",
    "1. Read data.\n",
    "2. Apply three techniques for filter selection:\n",
    "    - Filter methods\n",
    "    - Wrapper methods\n",
    "    - Embedded methods.\n",
    "3. Describe your findings."
